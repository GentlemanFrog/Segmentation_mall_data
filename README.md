# Segmentation_mall_data
A creative project to perfomr data segmentation

## The aim:
The aim of this project is making a segmentation anylasis on the mall clients data set. (Data stored in the
Mall_Customers.csv file). The data comes from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shwetabh123/mall-customers

In this project I want to get information about the age, gender, interest etc. to to see what the structure 
of customers in this data set looks like, whether there are any specific clusters,
whether groups of customers with specific interests stand out, etc.
